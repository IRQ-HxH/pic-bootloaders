Open source Microchip PIC boot loaders and associated applications / utilities and general information.

Our Wiki contains a list of [currently available boot loaders](AvailableBootloaders.md), mainly for the PIC18F range. Please feel free to edit and add to the wiki pages.

Our aim is to make available an open source boot loader for the PIC18F2550, but it should be easily portable to other PIC18s, and will use the same protocol as [Tiny PIC bootloader](http://www.etc.ugal.ro/cchiculita/software/picbootloader.htm) developed by Claudiu Chiculita.


If you would like to add your own PIC bootloader to our source repository (or make changes to the existing code) please [email joseph](mailto:joseph@heenan.me.uk) to be added as a project member.
